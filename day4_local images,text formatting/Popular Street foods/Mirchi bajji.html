    <h1>Mirchi Bajji</h1>
    <p><strong>Mirchi Bajji</strong> is a popular street food and snack in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, made by deep-frying large green chilies stuffed with a flavorful filling and coated in a spiced chickpea flour batter. The dish is known for its crunchy exterior, soft filling, and spicy kick from the chilies. It is often served with chutneys or dipped in chai, making it a favorite during the monsoon season.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <p>Large green chilies</p>
    <p>Besan and Rice flour</p>
    <p>Baking soda and Carom seeds</p>
    <p>Carom seeds and Turmeric powder</p>
    <p>Tamarind pulp and Ajwan</p>
    <p> Red chili powder and Salt</p>
    <h2>Preparation:</h2>
    <p>Wash the large green chilies and pat them dry. Make a vertical slit in each chili, taking care not to cut them fully, and remove the seeds (depending on your heat tolerance, you can leave some seeds).
        If using a stuffing, mix tamarind pulp with ajwain, cumin powder, and grated coconut. Gently stuff the mixture into the slit chilies.
        In a bowl, mix besan, rice flour, baking soda, carom seeds, turmeric powder, red chili powder, and salt.
        Add water gradually to form a thick, smooth batter. The batter should be thick enough to coat the chilies well but not too runny.
        Heat oil in a deep pan or kadai for frying.
        Dip each stuffed chili into the batter, ensuring itâ€™s fully coated, and carefully drop it into the hot oil.
        Fry on medium heat until the bajjis are golden brown and crisp on all sides.
        Remove the fried bajjis and place them on a paper towel to drain excess oil.
        Chutneys: Mirchi Bajji is typically served with coconut chutney, tamarind chutney, or green chutney.
        Sprinkle chaat masala: For extra flavor, sprinkle a little chaat masala or lemon juice over the bajjis.
        Stuffing variations: In some regions, people also stuff the fried bajji with finely chopped onions, lemon juice, and coriander leaves after frying, giving it a street food twist.</p>

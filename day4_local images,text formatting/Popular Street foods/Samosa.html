    <h1>Samosa</h1>
    <p><strong>Samosa</strong> is one of the most popular and beloved snacks across India and is also enjoyed globally. It is a deep-fried, triangular pastry filled with a savory stuffing, typically made with spiced potatoes, peas, and occasionally lentils or minced meat. Samosas are known for their crispy, flaky exterior and flavorful filling. They are commonly served with chutneys and are a staple at tea time, parties, and celebrations.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <p>All-purpose flour and Ajwain</p>
    <p>Salt and Ghee or oil</p>
    <p>Water and potatoes</p>
    <p>Green peas and Green chillies</p>
    <p>Ginger and cumin seeds</p>
    <p>Coriander powder and garam masala</p>
    <p>Red chilli powder and Turmeric powder</p>
    <p>Amchur powder and Coriander leaves</p>
    <p>oil and salt</p>
    <h2>Preparation:</h2>
    <p>Step 1: Prepare the Dough
        Mix the dough:
        In a bowl, mix all-purpose flour, carom seeds, salt, and ghee (or oil). Rub the ghee into the flour until the mixture becomes crumbly.
        Gradually add water and knead into a firm dough. Cover with a damp cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes.
        Step 2: Make the Potato Filling
        Heat oil in a pan:
        
        Heat a little oil in a pan and add cumin seeds. Once they splutter, add ginger and green chilies. Saut√© for a minute.
        Add spices:
        
        Add turmeric powder, coriander powder, garam masala, red chili powder, and amchur powder. Stir well to combine.
        Add potatoes and peas:
        
        Add boiled and mashed potatoes and green peas. Cook for a few minutes, stirring frequently so the spices blend well with the potatoes.
        Season and finish:
        
        Add salt and coriander leaves. Mix everything well and cook for a couple more minutes. Let the filling cool down.
        Step 3: Assemble the Samosa
        Roll the dough:
        
        Divide the dough into small balls and roll each ball into a thin oval or circle. Cut it in half to form two semicircles.
        Form the cone:
        
        Take one semicircle and fold it into a cone shape by sealing the straight edges with water. Press the edges firmly.
        Fill the cone:
        
        Fill the cone with 1 to 2 tablespoons of the prepared potato filling. Be careful not to overfill.
        Seal the samosa:
        
        Seal the top of the cone by pressing the edges together and using water to stick the dough. Make sure the edges are tightly sealed to prevent the filling from spilling out during frying.
        Step 4: Fry the Samosa
        Heat oil:
        Heat oil in a deep frying pan or kadai on medium heat.
        Fry the samosas:
        Once the oil is hot, carefully slide in the samosas and fry them on medium-low heat until they turn golden brown and crispy. This slow frying ensures the crust becomes perfectly crisp.
        Drain excess oil:
        Remove the samosas from the oil and drain them on a paper towel to remove excess oil.
        Serving:
        Chutneys: Samosas are typically served with tamarind chutney (sweet and tangy) and mint-coriander chutney (spicy and fresh).
        With chai: They are often enjoyed with a hot cup of chai (tea) in the evening.</p>

    <h1>Punugulu</h1>
    <p><strong>Punugulu</strong> is a popular street food snack from Andhra Pradesh, particularly from the coastal regions like Vijayawada and Visakhapatnam. It is made using fermented idli or dosa batter, which is deep-fried into crispy, golden-brown fritters. Punugulu has a soft interior and a crunchy exterior, making it a beloved snack, especially during the monsoon season. Itâ€™s often served with coconut chutney or a spicy tomato chutney.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <p>Dosa or idli batter</p>
    <p>Rice flour and Onions</p>
    <p>Green chilies and Cumin seeds</p>
    <p>Coriander leaves and Ginger</p>
    <p>Salt and oil</p>
    <h2>Preparation:</h2>
    <p>If using leftover dosa or idli batter, add a little rice flour to make the batter thicker and crisper when fried. The batter should have a dropping consistency, thick but still pourable.
        Add flavorings:
        To the batter, mix in chopped onions, green chilies, cumin seeds, chopped coriander, ginger, and salt to enhance the taste.
        Rest the batter:
        Let the batter rest for about 10 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.
        Step 2: Fry the Punugulu
        Heat oil:
        
        Heat oil in a deep frying pan or kadai over medium-high heat.
        Drop spoonfuls of batter:
        
        Once the oil is hot, drop spoonfuls of the batter into the oil using a spoon or your hand. Ensure not to overcrowd the pan.
        Fry until golden brown:
        
        Fry the punugulu in batches, turning them occasionally to ensure they are evenly golden brown and crispy on all sides.
        Drain excess oil:
        
        Remove the fried punugulu and drain them on a paper towel to remove excess oil.
        Serving:
        Chutneys: Punugulu is typically served with coconut chutney, ginger chutney, or tomato chutney.
        Spicy powder: In some places, it's also served with a spicy podi (chutney powder) for extra flavor.</p>

    <h1>Chai</h1>
    <p><strong>Chai</strong> is more than just a beverage in India; it’s a cultural staple, often enjoyed several times a day and shared in social settings. "Chai" means tea in Hindi, and it is typically prepared with black tea leaves, milk, water, sugar, and a blend of warming spices. This concoction, known as Masala Chai, offers a rich, aromatic, and slightly spicy flavor that is both comforting and energizing. Chai is an integral part of Indian hospitality and is often served to guests and enjoyed with snacks like samosas, biscuits, or pakoras.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <p>2 cups water</p>
    <p>2 tsp tea powder</p>
    <p>4-5 green cardamom pods</p>
    <p>1 cup milk and Sugar</p>
    <h2>Preparation:</h2>
    <p>Step 1: Crush the Cardamom
        Take 4-5 green cardamom pods and crush them lightly using a mortar and pestle. This helps release the cardamom’s essential oils, enhancing the flavor of the tea.
        Step 2: Boil Water with Cardamom
        In a saucepan, bring 2 cups of water to a boil.
        Add the crushed cardamom pods to the boiling water and let it simmer for 2-3 minutes. This allows the cardamom to infuse the water with its fragrance and flavor.
        Step 3: Add Tea Leaves
        Once the water is infused with cardamom, add 2 teaspoons of black tea leaves (or tea powder). Let it simmer for another 2-3 minutes, allowing the tea to brew properly.
        Step 4: Add Milk and Sugar
        Add 1 cup of milk to the boiling tea and cardamom mixture. Adjust the milk quantity based on how strong or light you like your tea.
        Add sugar according to your taste and bring the mixture to a boil again.
        Step 5: Strain and Serve
        After the tea has boiled for a minute or two with the milk, remove it from heat.
        Strain the tea into cups using a fine sieve to remove the tea leaves and cardamom pods.
        Serve hot!</p>

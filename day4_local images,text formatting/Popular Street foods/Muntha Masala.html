    <h1>Muntha masala</h1>
    <p><strong>Muntha Masala</strong> is a spicy and tangy street food snack from Andhra Pradesh, particularly famous in the regions of Guntur and Vijayawada. It’s a popular evening snack that combines puffed rice, a variety of chutneys, crunchy fried snacks, onions, and a range of spices. Similar to bhel puri but with a unique Andhra twist, Muntha Masala is known for its intense heat and bold flavors.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <p>Puffed rice and Fried Peanuts</p>
    <p>Raw onions and Tomatoes</p>
    <p>Green chilies and Coriander leaves</p>
    <p>Lemon juice and Chaat masala</p>
    <p>Red chili powder and Cumin powder</p>
    <p>Tamarind chutney, Garlic Chutney and Mint-coriander chutney</p>
    <p>salt and oil or ghee</p>
    <h2>Preparation:</h2>
    <p>Step 1: Roast the Puffed Rice
        Heat a pan and lightly roast the puffed rice for a few minutes on low heat to make it crispier. This step is optional but recommended for a better texture.
        Step 2: Prepare the Chutneys
        Tamarind chutney: Combine tamarind pulp with jaggery, chili powder, and cumin powder. Simmer until thick and set aside.
        Mint-coriander chutney: Blend fresh mint, coriander, green chilies, lemon juice, and a pinch of salt to make a spicy, green chutney.
        Garlic chutney: Blend garlic, red chilies, and salt for a fiery chutney (this is optional if you want extra heat).
        Step 3: Mix the Ingredients
        In a large mixing bowl, add the roasted puffed rice.
        Mix in chopped onions, tomatoes, green chilies, and coriander leaves.
        Add a handful of fried snacks like boondi, sev, or mixture for extra crunch.
        Pour in the tamarind chutney, mint-coriander chutney, and garlic chutney (optional) for a burst of flavors.
        Squeeze in lemon juice and sprinkle chaat masala, red chili powder, cumin powder, and salt. Toss everything together quickly to coat the puffed rice evenly.
        Step 4: Final Touches
        For an extra flavor boost, drizzle a little oil or ghee on top.
        Garnish with some more coriander leaves and, optionally, add fried peanuts, grated carrot, or cucumber for added texture.
        Serving:
        Serve Muntha Masala immediately after mixing to retain the crispness of the puffed rice and fried snacks.
        It’s best enjoyed as an evening snack or during casual get-togethers.</p>

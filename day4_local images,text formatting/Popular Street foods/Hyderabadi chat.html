    <h1>Hyderabadi chaat</h1>
    <p><strong>Hyderabadi Chaat</strong> is a delightful mix of sweet, tangy, spicy, and savory flavors, reflecting the rich street food culture of Hyderabad. This chaat is a medley of crisp fried snacks, boiled chickpeas, potatoes, onions, and a variety of chutneys. What makes it unique is the incorporation of Hyderabadi elements like sev puri, ragda, and the use of spicy and tangy chutneys. While it shares similarities with North Indian chaat, the local spices and flavors make it stand out.</p>

        Step 2: Add Chutneys
        Drizzle the chaat with tamarind chutney for sweetness, green chutney for a herby spice, and a bit of garlic chutney for extra heat.
        Step 3: Add Yogurt
        Spoon some fresh, whisked yogurt over the top for a cooling effect that balances the flavors.
        Step 4: Sprinkle Spices
        Generously sprinkle chaat masala, red chili powder, roasted cumin powder, and a dash of black salt for an explosion of flavors.
        Step 5: Garnish
        Top with finely chopped onions, fresh coriander leaves, and a handful of sev or boondi for crunch.
        For an authentic Hyderabadi touch, you can also add a few pomegranate seeds or finely chopped raw mango for bursts of tanginess.
        Variations:
        Ragda Pattice Chaat: Another popular version where spiced mashed potato patties (pattice) are served with a spicy white pea gravy (ragda).
        Dahi Puri: Small puris are filled with chickpeas, potatoes, and chutneys, then topped with yogurt and spices.
        Hyderabadi Bhel Puri: A dry chaat where puffed rice is mixed with sev, papdi, onions, tomatoes, and chutneys, offering a more crunchy and light variation.
        Serving:
        Hyderabadi Chaat is best served fresh and immediately after preparation to retain the crunch of the puris and sev.
        Itâ€™s usually eaten as a snack in the evening or during festivals and gatherings.</p>

    <h1>Hyderabadi Biryani</h1>
    <p><strong>Hyderabadi Biryani</strong> is one of the most iconic and flavorful dishes from Hyderabad, combining aromatic basmati rice with marinated meat (usually chicken or mutton) and a rich blend of spices. Known for its royal Mughlai roots and Nizami heritage, Hyderabadi biryani is famous for its distinct flavor, fragrant aroma, and the technique of slow-cooking (called dum cooking).</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <p>Basmati rice and Whole spices</p>
    <p>Saffron and Mint leaves</p>
    <p>Meat and Ginger-garlic paste</p>
    <p>Spices and Fried onions</p>
    <p>Lemon juice and Ghee</p>
    <h2>Preparation:</h2>
    <p>Combine meat with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric, biryani masala, lemon juice, and fried onions (birista). Marinate for a few hours or overnight for maximum flavor.        
        Parboil the basmati rice with whole spices (bay leaves, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, etc.) until itâ€™s about 70% cooked. Drain and set aside.
        In a large, heavy-bottomed pot, layer the marinated meat at the bottom. Layer half-cooked rice on top of the meat.
        Drizzle with saffron-infused milk or water, ghee, and sprinkle fresh mint and coriander leaves.
        Add more fried onions for extra flavor and texture.        
        Seal the pot with dough or a tight-fitting lid to trap steam (this is called dum cooking).
        Cook on a very low flame for 30-40 minutes, allowing the steam to cook the meat and finish cooking the rice.
        Alternatively, you can place the sealed pot in a preheated oven for slow cooking.        
        Once cooked, gently fluff the rice, mixing it with the juicy, flavorful meat at the bottom.
        <strong>Hyderabadi biryani is typically served with:</strong>
        <em>Mirchi ka Salan:</em> A spicy chili and peanut curry.
        <em>Raita:</em> A cooling yogurt-based accompaniment with onions, cucumbers, or boondi.
        <em>Sliced onions and lemon wedges:</em> For added freshness and zing.</p>

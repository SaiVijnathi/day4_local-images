    <h1>Bagara Baingan</h1>
    <p><strong>Bagara Baingan</strong> is a classic Hyderabadi dish featuring small, tender brinjals cooked in a rich, flavorful, and tangy peanut, sesame, and coconut gravy. It's a popular side dish that’s often served with biryani or steamed rice. The combination of roasted spices and a smooth, nutty gravy gives it a distinctive taste that represents the Mughlai-inspired cuisine of Hyderabad.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <p>Small brinjals and oil</p>
    <p>Turmeric powder</p>
    <p>Peanuts and Sesame seeds</p>
    <p>Coconut and Onions</p>
    <p>Cumin seeds and mustard seeds</p>
    <p>Curry leaves and Tamarind pulp</p>
    <p>Green chilies and Ginger-garlic paste</p>
    <p>Spices and Jaggery</p>
    <h2>Preparation:</h2>
    <p>Wash and make slits in the small eggplants, keeping the stems intact. This allows the masala to penetrate the eggplants.
        Heat oil in a pan, shallow-fry the eggplants until they are soft but still holding their shape. Remove and set aside.  
        Dry roast peanuts, sesame seeds, and grated coconut separately until aromatic and golden.
        Once cooled, grind these roasted ingredients into a smooth paste by adding a little water.
        In the same pan, heat some more oil and add cumin seeds, mustard seeds, and curry leaves.
        Add finely chopped onions and sauté until golden brown.
        Add ginger-garlic paste and cook until the raw smell disappears.
        Stir in turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander powder, and the prepared peanut-sesame-coconut paste.
        Cook the masala on low heat, adding water to reach a thick gravy consistency.    
        Add tamarind pulp to the gravy and cook for a few minutes until the tangy flavor mellows down.
        Optionally, add a small piece of jaggery to balance the tanginess and spice.     
        Add the fried eggplants to the gravy and gently stir to coat them with the masala.
        Cover the pan and simmer for 10-15 minutes, allowing the eggplants to absorb the flavors of the gravy. 
        Finish with fresh coriander leaves and a dash of garam masala for extra fragrance.</p>

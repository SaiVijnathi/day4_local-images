    <h1>Thalikalu</h1>
    <p><strong>Thalikalu</strong> is a traditional sweet dish from Andhra Pradesh, particularly popular during the festival of Vinayaka Chavithi (Ganesh Chaturthi). It consists of handmade rice flour noodles cooked in a creamy, jaggery-flavored syrup with cardamom and garnished with ghee and dry fruits. This dish is a type of sweet payasam (kheer) and is known for its unique texture and festive significance.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <p>Rice flour and water</p>
    <p>Ghee and salt</p>
    <p>Jaggery and Cardamom powder</p>
    <p>Ghee and Dryfruits</p>
    <p>Milk and Water</p>
    <h2>Preparation:</h2>
    <p> Heat water in a pan with a pinch of salt and a teaspoon of ghee.
        Gradually add rice flour to the boiling water, stirring constantly to avoid lumps. Mix until it forms a smooth dough.
        Let the dough cool slightly. Once manageable, knead it until smooth.
        Take small portions of the dough and roll them into long, thin strands, similar to noodles. These are your thalikalu.
        In a separate pan, dissolve jaggery in water and bring it to a boil. Simmer until it forms a slightly thick syrup. Strain it to remove impurities if needed.
        In a large pot, bring water to a boil and add the rice noodles (thalikalu) to it. Cook until they are soft and fully cooked.
        Drain the water and set aside the cooked noodles.
        Pour the jaggery syrup into the cooked noodles and let them simmer together on low heat for a few minutes so that the noodles absorb the sweet syrup.
        Add milk to the mixture for creaminess and let it simmer until the desired consistency is reached.
        Stir in cardamom powder for aroma and flavor.
        In a small pan, heat ghee and fry cashews, almonds, and raisins until golden brown.
        Pour the fried dry fruits along with the ghee over the thalikalu payasam.
        Warm or cold: Thalikalu is typically served warm but can also be enjoyed at room temperature.
        It is often offered as a prasadam during Vinayaka Chavithi celebrations.</p>

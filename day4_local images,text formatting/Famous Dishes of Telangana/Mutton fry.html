    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <p>Mutton and onions</p>
    <p>Green chillies and Ginger-garlic paste</p>
    <p>Tomatoes and Red chilli powder</p>
    <p>Turmeric powder and oil</p>
    <p>Coriander powder and Garam masala</p>
    <p>Coriander leaves and Curry leaves</p>
    <h2>Preparation:</h2>
    <p>Start by boiling or pressure-cooking the mutton with salt, turmeric, and water until tender. This process ensures the meat is soft and ready for frying.
        Heat oil in a heavy-bottomed pan and add cumin seeds.
        Add sliced onions and saut√© until golden brown.
        Add curry leaves, green chilies, and ginger-garlic paste, cooking until the raw smell disappears.
        Add tomatoes and cook until they soften and blend into the mixture.
        Add red chili powder, coriander powder, and garam masala, stirring to combine well.
        Cook the spices until the oil separates from the masala.  
        Add the cooked mutton pieces to the pan, ensuring they're well-coated with the masala.
        Fry on medium to high heat, allowing the mutton to absorb the spices and get slightly crispy around the edges.
        Continue frying until the dish reaches a semi-dry consistency, or fry it further for a drier, crispy finish.
        Finish with fresh coriander leaves for added flavor.
        <strong>Golichina Mamsam is typically served with:</strong>        
        Steamed rice or pulihora (tamarind rice),
        Rotis, chapatis, or parathas and
        A side of raita or curd to balance the spiciness.</p>

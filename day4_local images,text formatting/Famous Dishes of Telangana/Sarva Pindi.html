    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <p>Rice flour and Chana dal </p>
    <p>Green chillies and Ginger</p>
    <p>Curry leaves and Cumin seeds</p>
    <p>Sesame seeds and onions</p>
    <p>Turmeric and salt</p>
    <p>Water and oil</p>
    <h2>Preparation:</h2>
    <p>Soak chana dal for about 30 minutes to soften it slightly.
        In a bowl, mix rice flour, soaked chana dal, chopped onions, green chilies, ginger, curry leaves, cumin seeds, sesame seeds, turmeric, and salt. Add water gradually to form a soft, pliable dough.
        Take a ball of the dough and flatten it on a greased pan or plate using your fingers.
        The pancake should be about 1/4 inch thick, and small holes should be made throughout the pancake using your fingers or a spoon to help it cook evenly.
        Heat oil in a pan and place the shaped dough on the pan (if shaped on a plate, invert it onto the hot pan).
        Cook on low to medium heat, adding a little oil around the edges and in the holes, until the pancake turns golden brown and crispy on both sides.
        It’s cooked slowly to ensure a crispy outer layer and a soft interior.
        <strong>Sarvapindi is best enjoyed hot, served with:</strong>        
        <em>Pickle:</em> To add a tangy, spicy element.
        <em>Coconut chutney:</em> For a cooling contrast.
        <em>Tea:</em> It’s often paired with a hot cup of chai for a perfect snack.</p>

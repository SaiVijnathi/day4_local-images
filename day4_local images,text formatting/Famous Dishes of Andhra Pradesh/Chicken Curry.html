    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <p>Chicken</p>
    <p>Onions, finely chopped</p>
    <p>Tomatoes, pureed</p>
    <p>Ginger-garlic paste</p>
    <p>Green chilies, slit</p>
    <p>Fresh coriander leaves</p>
    <p>Yogurt</p>
    <p>Spices: Red chili powder, turmeric, coriander powder, garam masala</p>
    <p>Whole spices: Cloves, cinnamon stick, cardamom pods</p>
    <p>Oil</p>
    <p>Salt and water</p>
    <h2>Preparation:</h2>
    <p>Begin by marinating the chicken in yogurt, turmeric, and red chili powder. This helps tenderize the meat and infuse it with flavors. Allow it to marinate for at least 30 minutes, or overnight for best results.
        Heat oil or ghee in a heavy-bottomed pan. Add whole spices like cloves, cinnamon, and cardamom to the hot oil, allowing them to release their aroma. Saut√© finely chopped onions until they turn golden brown. Add the ginger-garlic paste and green chilies, cooking until the raw smell dissipates.
        Incorporate the tomato puree and cook until the oil starts to separate from the masala. Add turmeric, coriander powder, and red chili powder. Stir well to blend the spices.
        Add the marinated chicken pieces to the pan, stirring to coat them with the spice mix. Cook for a few minutes, allowing the chicken to absorb the flavors. Add water as needed to reach the desired consistency of the curry.
        Cover and simmer the curry on low heat until the chicken is tender and cooked through. Adjust seasoning with salt and add garam masala towards the end for extra flavor.
        Finish with fresh coriander leaves for a burst of freshness and color. Serve hot with steamed rice, biryani, or Indian breads like roti or naan.</p>

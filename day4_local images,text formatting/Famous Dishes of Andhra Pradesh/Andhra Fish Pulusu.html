    <h1>Ingredients:</h1>
    <p>Fish</p>
    <p>Tamarind</p>
    <p>Onions and tomatoes</p>
    <p>Green chilies and red chili powder</p>
    <p>Turmeric and coriander powder</p>

    <h2>Preparation:</h2>
    <p>The fish is marinated with turmeric, red chili powder, and salt, and set aside for some time.
        Tamarind is soaked in water, and the pulp is extracted to create a tangy base.
        Heat oil in a pan and add mustard seeds, fenugreek seeds, and curry leaves until they splutter.
        Add chopped onions, green chilies, and ginger-garlic paste. Saut√© until the onions turn golden brown, then add tomatoes and cook until soft.
        Add turmeric, red chili powder, coriander powder, and the tamarind extract. Allow the mixture to simmer until the raw smell of the tamarind disappears and the oil starts to separate.
        Gently place the marinated fish pieces into the gravy and let it cook on low heat until the fish is fully cooked and has absorbed the flavors.
        Top with fresh coriander leaves.
        Andhra Fish Pulusu is best enjoyed with:        
        <em>Steamed rice:</em> The tangy, spicy gravy pairs perfectly with plain rice.

        Divide: Divide the dough and filling into equal portions.
        Roll: Roll out a small portion of dough into a small circle, place a portion of the filling in the center, and fold the edges over the filling to seal.
        Flatten: Gently roll out the filled dough into a flatbread, being careful not to let the filling leak out.
        Cook:    
        Heat a griddle: Place the rolled-out bobbatlu on a hot griddle or tawa.

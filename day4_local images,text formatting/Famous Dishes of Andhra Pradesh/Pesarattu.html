    <p><strong>Pesarattu</strong> is a popular dish from Andhra Pradesh, known for its delicious flavor and nutritious content. It's essentially a savory green gram (moong dal) pancake and is often enjoyed as a breakfast or snack. Pesarattu is loved for its high protein content (thanks to the green gram) and is a healthy, gluten-free, and filling dish. Its crisp edges and soft interior make it a favorite breakfast choice in Andhra Pradesh.</p>
